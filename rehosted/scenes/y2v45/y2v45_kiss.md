<p>“Ahhh… Today is the last day of summer vacation.”</p>

<p>Kei said that, sitting down on the bed making a ‘pah’ sound and raising her head to look at the ceiling sadly.</p>

<p>In order to reveal our relationship gradually in the second semester, I and my girlfriend, Karuizawa Kei, had been having regular secret dates. Today would be the last of those dates.</p>

<p>Even though I couldn't fully concentrate when I spent time with her, it was not uncomfortable at all.</p>

<p>If we were friends who didn’t know each other well, we might feel restless having to find words to talk about.</p>

<p>“Starting from tomorrow, it would be fine for me to tell others about my relationship with Kiyotaka… I am kind of nervous.”</p>

<p>“You don’t need to force yourself to tell others. I won’t take responsibility if your status in the class falls.”</p>

<p>“I will say it absolutely. Even if anything happens, it’s alright because you will protect me, right?”</p>

<p>Although Kei seemed to be joking, it was without a doubt her true feelings.</p>

<p>As a parasite attached to a strong host, Kei was protecting herself.</p>

<p>I finished the last sip of my coffee and sat down next to Kei.</p>

<p>When I held her slim hand, she gently returned my gesture. Kei turned towards me, looking embarrassed.</p>

<p>"Kei"</p>

<p>At that moment, I laid my lips over her soft lips.</p>

<p>"Ki-Kiyotaka..."</p>

<p>"Surprised?"</p>

<p>"Y-Yes, I was. C-Couldn't you have let me know in advance...?"</p>

<p>I didn't reply to that question with words, but with actions.</p>

<p>I gently grabbed her shoulders and drew her close to me.</p>

<p>"Hmph...!"</p>

<p>The second kiss. Once our lips touched, Kei's shoulder made a little leap in surprise.</p>

<p>Our lips shortly separated, and as if relieved, her eyes looked at me with reluctance.</p>

<p>"You caught me by surprise again..."</p>

<p>“Really? I thought it was quite normal.”</p>

<p>I would have to learn the timing to kiss by doing it repeatedly.</p>

<p>“At least, my heart isn't ready yet…...”</p>

<p>“Then, how about now? Are you ready?”</p>

<p>“Eh? ...Yeah…”</p>

<p>While nodding and saying that, Kei closed her eyes. After seeing her being ready, I kissed her again.</p>

<p>The two kisses until now only lasted around one second, but it was different this time.</p>

<p>5 seconds, 10 seconds, and longer…</p>

<p>And then we gradually moved our lips, repeating the kisses like small birds pecking each other.</p>

<p>During this frozen passage of time where it seems like there was only the two of us...</p>

<p>We were in our 2nd-year of high school. On the last day of the summer vacation, I and Kei learned about kissing and took another step forward in our relationship.</p>

<p>The first half of the curriculum of love had ended, and we had begun the second half.</p>

<p>From now on, both of us would openly live our school lives as a couple.</p>

<p>As a result, we might get into some troubles, but we would face the difficulties together hand in hand.</p>

<p>Although slowly, we were definitely taking small steps forward, as the seasons change from summer to autumn, from autumn to winter.</p>

<p>We would dye our relationship with our deep, deep colours and make it indispensable to us.</p>

<p>While we were repeatedly confirming the taste of our lips, my thoughts were involuntarily drifting towards the future.</p>

<p>When the season of farewells would finally come, this romance would meet its conclusion—</p>

<p>Because it's already fated to meet an utmost difficult trial.</p>

<p>Karuizawa Kei would need to stand up and face what lies ahead even if she broke away from her host.</p>

<p>That was the most important part in this curriculum of love.</p>
