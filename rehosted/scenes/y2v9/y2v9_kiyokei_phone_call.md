<p>Even though I had sowed the seeds myself, I got involved in something that only half related to me.</p>

<p>If anything, I would have liked to settle things with Nagumo through the student council elections or something else, but because Ichinose’s withdrawal was out of everyone’s expectations, there was nothing I could do about it.</p>

<p>I decided to call to report to my girlfriend, who was waiting at the dormitory.</p>

<p>[Are you still not back yet!?]</p>

<p>As soon as the call started, Kei's dissatisfied voice came out.</p>

<p>"I just left the student council room. I'll be back in about 15 minutes."</p>

<p>I thought I might get scolded, but it seemed that the happiness of knowing the precise time won out.</p>

<p>[Alright. I waited patiently without urging you to be quick. Aren't I amazing?]</p>

<p>Suddenly, her tone softened as she asked me that.</p>

<p>"You're amazing, amazing."</p>

<p>Girls like Kei were good at using their phones.</p>

<p>So, it would be easy for her to send messages promptly every few seconds.</p>

<p>[Hehehe.]</p>

<p>It wasn't really something worth praising, but she seemed happy with my compliment.</p>

<p>[Then, I’ll wait for you.]</p>

<p>After ending that brief exchange, I put my phone back in my pocket.</p>

<p>As we progressed through the romantic phase, I realized that even without lengthy conversations, our relationship was being established.</p>

<p>Only family members could sense slight differences, not because they were smart or sharp, but because they were aware of changes that could only be noticed through spending a long time together.</p>

<p>It was not about thinking with your head and trying to read the other person's thoughts, but about feeling each other's touch.</p>

<p>It was possible to change a moment of tension into a moment of softness in an instant.</p>

<p>It was like the two sides of a coin.</p>

<p>This concept applied to many other things beyond what had just been mentioned.</p>

<p>The remaining pages of the textbook were decreasing by the second.</p>

<p>However, the more the textbook reaches its final stage, the more difficult it is to understand and takes more time than at the beginning of the book.</p>

<p>Then——the next task is——</p>
