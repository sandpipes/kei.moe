<p>"Kiyotaka! Sorry to keep you waiting!"</p>

<p>At this moment, Kei called out from the dormitory's direction while running up to me out of breath.</p>

<p>"Aren't you only a few minutes late? Don't worry about it too much."</p>

<p>"Yeah, but... By the way, aren't you cold waiting outside?"</p>

<p>She showed a curious look as we were originally going to meet up at the lobby of the dormitory.</p>

<p>"It's fine. More importantly, you still got a bit of a bedhead."</p>

<p>She must have been in quite a hurry that I discovered and pointed out a mistake uncharacteristic of her.</p>

<p>"Really? I hate it!"</p>

<p>Kei pressed her hands against her head embarrassingly. Then she hurriedly used her hands as a comb to try to fix her bedhead.</p>

<p>However, no matter how many times she tried, her hair kept sticking back up a little.</p>

<p>"Uwa, what should I do...!"</p>

<p>"You don't have to be so concerned about that little bit, do you? The likes of Hondou and Ike come to class with worse bedheads."</p>

<p>"Don't compare me to boys like them~! Ugh, I will stop by the bathroom after arriving at school..."</p>

<p>Kei began walking while covering the part of her bedhead with her hand embarrassingly.</p>

<p>Well, it's not a bad thing to pay attention to one's fashion style and appearance like that.</p>
