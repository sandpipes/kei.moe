<p>There was a little box resting in my hand. It was so light, yet it felt so heavy.</p>

<p>My heart rate was rising like the high tide. It easily surpassed 120 beats per minute.</p>

<p>«So, I’m going to confirm something, fine with you?» I asked.</p>

<p>Trying to conceal my nervousness, I looked at Kiyotaka. But I couldn’t meet his eyes. My gaze flickered around his nose disguising trying to act as if I was looking at him.</p>

<p>I’m confident that I would swoon looking directly in his eyes now.</p>

<p>A birthday plus white day gift from Kiyotaka.</p>

<p>I neatly unwrapped it so it could be wrapped again later. Then— I opened the cover.</p>

<p>«Wha…What is this!?»</p>

<p>I screamed out my first impression before I knew it.</p>

<p>A heart-shaped necklace shining in gold.</p>

<p>«It’s a necklace.»</p>

<p>«Yeah, even I can see that! A too heavy present, you know!»</p>

<p>I mean, isn’t that almost a confession!?</p>

<p>N-no, I’ve never been confessed to so I can’t be sure.</p>

<p>But, but, I was sure it was a present way surpassing what friends give each other.</p>

<p>I faintly remember that I said he should return the favour many times back, but that was just meant as a little joke.</p>

<p>«Heavy?»</p>

<p>I wasn’t sure whether to be happy or sad, that idiot was just looking as if he had no clue.</p>

<p>Even if that was intentional that would mean, well in other words, that right? I imagined an unreal situation, but then chased it in the furthest back on my mind.</p>

<p>«B-but you don’t give a necklace to a friend, you know!» I first have to tell him how strange this present was.</p>

<p>«And, and you know? It doesn’t seem to fit me either! This is heart-shaped, you know!»</p>

<p>It was true I didn’t think it would fit me, but that wasn’t the big issue.</p>

<p>This was the kind of thing that frequently made girls misunderstand, wasn’t it! Come on, really!</p>

<p>«Heart-shaped, you know!»</p>

<p>I thought I perhaps was being confessed to so accept my feelings !</p>

<p>«Fuu, fuu» (TN: Sound of huffing and puffing)</p>

<p>My feelings exploded without me realising it, but… that was probably my fault. He probably bought it since I requested a pricy gift in return. Listening to the full details later, I understood. It was something he, who had never gifted a present to a girl, had earnestly chosen.</p>

<p>In other words— it was his first gift.</p>

<p>Of course I will receive it.</p>

<p>Aah, he got me.</p>

<p>I thought as I was looking at myself, wearing the necklace, in the mirror.</p>

<p>Would a time come when I would wear this and go together with him somewhere? That would definitely be a very enjoyable day.</p>

<p>That I was certain of.</p>
