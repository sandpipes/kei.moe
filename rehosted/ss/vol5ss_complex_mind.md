<p>“We haven’t decided on any tactic, is that okay?”</p>
<p>Having already arranged our cavalry battle position, Shinohara, who was beneath me, muttered these words right before the competition started.</p>
<p>“I don’t think there’s any problem. In a sports festival, you only have to take it seriously to some extent.”</p>
<p>“Eh? Ah, ok. But Karuizawa-san, if you thing this is okay for you---“</p>
<p>“Do I look like that type of motivated person?”</p>
<p>“It’s because you opposed Horikita-san’s proposal when the class was deciding about the competitions by recommendation, so I was under the impression that…”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>That wasn’t my idea. I acted following that guy’s orders. Honestly, Horikita-san’s proposal about distributing the participants according to their abilities not only made things easier, but also it was a stratagem that ensured the success of the class. It could even be said that this was looking after the students who were unwilling to try hard. It seems that I was ordered by that guy to do some unnecessary things, causing me to be looked with different eyes by other people.</p>
<p>“In short, let’s do it at random”</p>
<p>“Roger--”</p>
<p>After saying these words, the cavalry battle began. There shouldn’t be anything extraordinary in the school’s cavalry battle –these thoughts were immediately subverted.</p>
<p>The reason being Class C quietly advancing forward and unceasingly attacking Class D. The vanguard was Ibuki-san. She was that existence that thrown my class into chaos.</p>
<p>Ibuki-san led the cavalry to do a surprise attack to Horikita-san.</p>
<p>“Shinohara, go! Support Horikita-san!</p>
<p>“Eh? Ro-roger!”</p>
<p>Even though she was surprised at me suddenly issuing an order, the horse still dashed forward.</p>
<p>“Although I’m not interested in winning, I don’t want to lose like this…!”</p>
<p>I didn’t know whether these words were said to Shinohara, or myself.</p>
<p>In brief, Horikita-san was targeted and leaving her alone would cause a terrible situation.</p>
<p>“Stop! I’m sorry, but I can’t let you go past here!”</p>
<p>The one who came to block us was Ichinose from Class B. Even though I haven’t really interacted with her that much, I thought she was difficult to handle.</p>
<p>“What do we do, Karuizawa-san…?”</p>
<p>Shinohara-san, who was holding the center position of the horse, sook for my instructions.</p>
<p>“We have no choice but to go forward, even though I don’t really want to do that”</p>
<p>My physical capabilities are not very outstanding and I don’t want to do troublesome things. But—</p>
<p>Right now that guy is probably looking here. Although I don’t know why, but I just don’t want that guy see me suffering a crushing defeat. That existence that knows about the darkness of my heart. That existence that said he will protect me.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Ichinose’s movements are not as difficult to handle as I thought. I can barely deal with her. While dodging her, I issued a specific instruction to Shinohara-san, to keep a suitable distance.</p>
<p>“Why am I trying so hard…?”</p>
<p>This time I was talking to myself. Everybody was trying hard so nobody heard my whisper.</p>
<p>During the summer vacation, I was also involved together with that guy. The same thing happened with this sports festival, making me help him with things I failed to understand. I just kept helping him, not knowing what he was doing or what he wanted to do. </p>
<p>Normally this would be unpleasant. But I don’t know why I never like this.</p>
<p>That’s certainly because the harm I’m really worried about deep down has not appeared.</p>
<p>The girls from Class C who wanted to look for problems with me haven’t come back again. Is this merely a coincidence? No, absolutely not. That guy… Ayanokouji-kun, did something for me.</p>
<p>Just because he let me have this premonition, that I’m obeying him.</p>
<p>“!?”</p>
<p>I barely evaded Ichinose’s hand.</p>
<p>“Ah, really, this doesn’t look like me!”</p>
<p>The image of Horikita’s horse falling entered my field of view. Ah, we are going to lose.</p>
<p>But the only thing I can do right now is to focus on the adversary in front of me.</p>
<p>I was gradually changing.</p>
<p>I was gradually receiving change.</p>
<p>But the unexpected thing was that I don’t dislike it.</p>
<p>Right now I’m unable to confront the gradually changing myself.</p>
