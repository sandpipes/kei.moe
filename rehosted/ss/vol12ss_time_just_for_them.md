<p>The surprising point wasn’t that he said how many points he wanted to take, or how many he could manage. That was made it so impressive.</p>

<p>«400 points.»</p>

<p>The amount he casually said he would take would be a pipe dream if I had said the same.</p>

<p>«…You serious? If I remember right, 400 points would be…»</p>

<p>I tried to remember what Chabashira-sensei had explained.</p>

<p>«Academics level A.»</p>

<p>«Y-you think just wishing it makes you able to do it?»</p>

<p>You normally wouldn’t get that many points just by merely studying.</p>

<p>In other words, he was saying that he could compete with Yukimura as of now too?</p>

<p>«It comes natural to me , but I haven’t encountered any problems I thought I couldn’t solve since I entered this school.»</p>

<p>I’m done. I can’t follow what he is saying…really. He’s so awesome.</p>

<p>So that means, it may be weird, but what he is saying is basically that he can control how many points he get?</p>

<p>A-and, doesn’t it sound like he could archieve full score if he decided to get serious?…</p>

<p>But his answer was so unrealistic that I couldn’t keep up with him.</p>

<p>I don’t think I’m lying when I say that my face probably looked like I was in the clouds right now.</p>

<p>«It’s because I can see everything that I know the risks and want you to focus.»</p>

<p>At any rate, I should listen to his warning since since he’s so impressive.</p>

<p>But it’s true that my heart wasn’t leaping out of joy by the idea of studying with Horikita and the rest.</p>

<p>«Well… maybe I should study a bit before I leave…»</p>

<p>Yes, I think I can do my best if it’s together with my boyfriend.</p>

<p>«I see. Then let’s start at once.»</p>

<p>He easily agreed to my modest wish.</p>

<p>I became more positive by seeing his appearance in front of me as he opened the notes and instructed me.</p>

<p>«Here, here.»</p>

<p>«Hmm?»</p>

<p>If that’s the case, better to sit side-by-side instead of facing one another.</p>

<p>I tapped the spot beside me, welcoming him to come over.</p>

<p>«Teach me from here, then»</p>

<p>He didn’t reject me, and slowly went over and sat down beside me.</p>

<p>It was if a gentle breeze had taken his scent along with it.</p>

<p>I became so happy that I for a moment didn’t care about studying at all. But I took the reins once again and focused.</p>

<p>In order to spend a fun school life with Kiyotaka.</p>
