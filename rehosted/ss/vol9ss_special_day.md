<p>February 14th. Underneath the cold winter sky, I came to this place, a slight distance away from the dorm. </p>
<p>An invitation from Kiyotaka via mobile to rendezvous here. </p>
<p>I had desperately been hiding my ever quickening heartbeat from Kiyotaka during our conversation.</p>
<p>To give someone chocolate. </p>
<p>If I were to start counting all the way from childhood, it wouldn't be my first time doing so. But whenever I let my guard down, I can feel my face reddening. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"What day is it today? Alright, 5, 4, 3---".</p>
<p>To conceal my embarrassment, I chose to poke fun at him with such a quiz.</p>
<p>"...that was easier than I expected. On the contrary, it's making me feel like I won't get it right".</p>
<p>"Don't beat around the bush, give me a straight answer, ok?".</p>
<p>It's okay. I just need to be the 'cool me'. It's okay. </p>
<p>"Valen---".</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Alright, correct answer".</p>
<p>I got really embarrassed and even as I covered it up with words, I hit Kiyotaka's head with the box. </p>
<p>"Is this for me?".</p>
<p>"I actually prepared this for Yousuke-kun but that's no longer necessary".</p>
<p>I lied. </p>
<p>The truth is, I bought it a while back while fretting over this and that. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I bought it just before the shop closed so I doubt anyone saw me. </p>
<p>"For Hirata, huh?".</p>
<p>"What? You don't like that?".</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"No, I was just thinking that meant you've spent quite a while preparing for Valentine's".</p>
<p>There's no way a phony, transparent lie like that would work against Kiyotaka but that phony lie is the only option I have here, isn't it?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If I told Kiyotaka I bought it for him then......that'd just make me look like a maiden in love!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I-I'm the thoroughly prepared type. Even though I decided I'd break up with him, there's still the possibility that it may become necessary, no? Well, there's no way someone as romantically inexperienced as you would understand that though".</p>
<p>It's precisely because I know he's romantically inexperienced that I was able to make this my escape route. </p>
<p>But still, surely even Kiyotaka would have had expectations? </p>
<p>After all, he knows today's February 14th. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I thought you picked this date because you expected to get something from me".</p>
<p>That's why I asked him that. </p>
<p>"Sorry, that didn't cross my mind".</p>
<p>Grr......</p>
<p>He has his usual poker face up and my words came bouncing straight back at me. </p>
<p>Even though I threw them hard at him straight up, he still kept his cool. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"By the way, did you get any from some other girl?".</p>
<p>I think I'll probably be able to hear his answer calmly. </p>
<p>"No, nothing at all".</p>
<p>In other words, this means I'm the first girl in this whole school to give Kiyotaka chocolate. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Serves you right. Zero Love Interest Man~".</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"But is it really okay? If you give me chocolate, it'll stop being zero, you know?".</p>
<p>"That in itself would make you pathetic. You'd be the guy who needed me to hand him a lifeline".</p>
<p>I wish today would end without this being known to anyone else. </p>
<p>And on White Day, I'll be able to monopolize Kiyotaka, won't I?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Just kidding, I mean, this would mean I'm nothing more than a maiden in love.......! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Inside my head, I had fallen into a state of panic.</p>
