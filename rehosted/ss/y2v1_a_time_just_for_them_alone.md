<p>It was Friday evening. I had gone to my boyfriend’s room to play. As if… we were going to study.</p>

<p>Usually this kind of things tend to lead to something romantic, but the chances of it happening was zilch.</p>

<p>It’s a pity that it felt like an extension of school however.</p>

<p>But I wasn’t that sad. It was precious alone time with him after all.</p>

<p>Being who I am, I asked him a bit about himself.</p>

<p>«By the way, there’s something I’ve been wondering ‘bout.»</p>

<p>«What is it?»</p>

<p>«I know you are teaching me and such, but aren’t you supposed to be ranked at C for academics? That’s so normal if you know what I mean? The truth is… you could have gotten something better, isn’t that right?»</p>

<p>«That’s how it is.»</p>

<p>I already knew he was pretty smart already.</p>

<p>I just didn’t know <span style="font-style: italic;">how</span> smart he was.</p>

<p>If he was at studying, being open about it would make people look at him more favourably I think.</p>

<p>«Your fighting I can understand, but why are you trying to hide everything else so much?»</p>

<p>«I don’t want to stand out, so I don’t see the need to take a better score.»</p>

<p>That seems like something he would say.</p>

<p>By how he’s been so quiet up until now, that seems understandable.</p>

<p>«Hey hey, how much could you get if you got serious?»</p>

<p>«Who knows.»</p>

<p>Who knows, he said? I instinctively revealed a smile due to how cool and serious he looked.</p>

<p>«Don’t try to hide it, tell me~?»</p>

<p>Something only I had heard, something he only told me.</p>

<p>That’s special… yes, something between couples.</p>

<p>It can’t be helped, he seemed to think while I was pestering him so he came up with this suggestion.</p>

<p>«If you show up at the study group from tomorrow on, I don’t mind telling you.»</p>

<p>I had been invited to the study group that was managed by Horikita-san a few times already.</p>

<p>I have always managed to avoid them until now. But it’s true, even I knew I needed to study.</p>

<p>«I will, I will! I realised just how bad it’s for me today!»</p>

<p>Yes, if I got a failing mark at any special exams now, I would be expelled.</p>

<p>I refuse to get expelled just after going out with him.</p>

<p>Finally realising how serious I was, he revealed it to me.</p>

<p>«Let’s leave aside how many points I could get. I’m wondering how many to get.»</p>

<p>«W-what’s that supposed to mean? It’s kinda sounds awesome, the way you’re putting it.»</p>

<p>The surprising part wasn’t that he said how many points he wanted to take, or how many he could manage. That was made it so impressive.</p>

<p>«400 points.»</p>

<p>The amount he casually said he would take would be a pipe dream if I had said the same.</p>

<p>«…You serious? If I remember right, 400 points would be…»</p>

<p>I tried to remember what Chabashira-sensei had explained.</p>

<p>«A in Academics.»</p>

<p>«Y-you think just wishing for it somehow makes it possible?»</p>

<p>You normally wouldn’t get that many points just by merely studying.</p>

<p>In other words, he was saying that he could compete with Yukimura as of now too?</p>

<p>«It comes natural to me and I haven’t encountered any problems I thought I couldn’t solve since I entered this school.»</p>

<p>I’m done. I can’t follow what he is saying…really. He’s so awesome.</p>

<p>So that means, it may be weird, but what he is saying is basically that he can control how many points he get?</p>

<p>A-and, doesn’t it sound like he could archieve full score if he decided to get serious?…</p>

<p>But his answer was so unrealistic that I couldn’t keep up with him.</p>

<p>I don’t think I’m lying when I say that my face probably looked like I was in the clouds right now.</p>

<p>«It’s because I can see everything that I know the risks and want you to focus.»</p>

<p>At any rate, I should listen to his warning since since he’s so impressive.</p>

<p>But it’s true that my heart wasn’t leaping out of joy by the idea of studying with Horikita and the rest.</p>

<p>«Well… maybe I should study a bit before I leave…»</p>

<p>Yes, I think I can do my best if it’s together with my boyfriend.</p>

<p>«I see. Then let’s start at once.»</p>

<p>He easily agreed to my modest wish.</p>

<p>I became more positive by seeing his appearance in front of me as he opened the notes and instructed me.</p>

<p>«Here, here.»</p>

<p>«Hmm?»</p>

<p>If that’s the case, better to sit side-by-side instead of facing one another.</p>

<p>I tapped the spot beside me, welcoming him to come over.</p>

<p>«Teach me from here, then»</p>

<p>He didn’t reject me, and slowly went over and sat down beside me.</p>

<p>It was if a gentle breeze had taken his scent along with it.</p>

<p>I became so happy that I for a moment didn’t care about studying at all. But I took the reins once again and focused.</p>

<p>In order to spend a fun school life with Kiyotaka.</p>
