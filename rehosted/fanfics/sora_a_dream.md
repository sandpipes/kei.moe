<p>“Kiyotaka—“</p>
<p>“Kei...”</p>
<p>Under the dim moonlight seeping through the window, I could vaguely make out Kiyotaka’s face. Whether it was the lighting or not, I thought I could see a hint of red on his cheeks which in turn made me feel the blood rush to my face.</p>
<p>I... I really can’t believe that this is happening.</p>
<p>I can feel my entire body flare up as I let out shallow breaths. Instinctively, my arms wrapped around warm Kiyotaka’s back.</p>
<p>I pulled him closer. He drew closer. I could feel his breaths send jolts through my skin as his lips neared. We were about to kiss. A-and do mu-much more! Finally after all this time!</p>
<p>As I felt his lips touch mine—</p>
<p>!?!?</p>
<p>*thwack*</p>
<p>“Urgh?”</p>
<p>Sleepily looking around, I could see faintly make out sunlight pouring through my room’s window. To the side I could see my bed, as well as my blanket falling onto the floor. In my arms, was a extremely misshapen pillow.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>W-was it... was it all JUST A DREAM!?!?</p>
<p>*THUMP!*</p>
<p>*thump! thump! thump!*</p>
<p>*thump! thump*</p>
<p>“Haah haah haah...”</p>
<p>“...WHY!?”</p>
<p>WHY WAS IT A DREAM!? WE HAVEN’T DONE ANYTHING SINCE THAT ONE KISS ON THE ISLAND!!! NO PROGRESS!!! WHYYYYYY!! THIS IS SOO UNFAIR!!!</p>
<p>*brr-brr*</p>
<p>*SLAM!*</p>
<p>“WHO IS IT!?”</p>
<p>“...Kei?”</p>
<p>“KIYOTAKA! THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT!”</p>
<p>“......Don’t worry. No matter what happens, I’ll take responsibility. I’m coming over right now.”</p>
<p>*biip*</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>His response was so astonishing that my mind completely cooled down as I processed what he said.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Wait? What? Coming over? Why?</p>
<p>“I’ll take responsibility...”   “I’ll take responsibility...”   “I’ll take responsibility...”</p>
<p>D-d-does that m-mean...</p>
