<p>My very first date ever has just began</p>
<p>Kei seemed nervous when met up but, she seems to have returned to her usual attitude as she sticks close to me and begins walking.</p>
<p>".....too close".</p>
<p>I whispered that without thinking in a voice too low for her to hear. ' Wait, hold on, This how we are supposed to walk. I'm still not used to this, huh '</p>
<p>" Kiyotaka... "</p>
<p>"Yeah? "</p>
<p>" You changed, You've grown up a bit "</p>
<p>I changed, huh? I've grown up a bit, huh? She already told me that I'm some centimeters taller the last time we met. So, what does You've grown up supposed to mean?</p>
<p>" I've changed you say? "</p>
<p>She jumped in front of me and said</p>
<p>" I don't claim that I know you as a person or what goes through your mind, yet. But, I know that the old Kiyotaka wouldn't say 'that'"</p>
<p>'So, even Kei can act cute sometimes, huh ... More importantly, What does the That she said refers to though? Wait, could it be ...</p>
<p>" Heeeeeeeeee! Kiyotaka ! even a poker face like you can blush sometimes, well it's not like this is the first time I saw you blushing " ( Vol 11: While he was given the gift to Kei, Kiyotaka blushed )</p>
<p>She saw me blushing before, huh?</p>
<p>" Even a bullish girl like you can be sometimes cute "</p>
<p>" Wait, you are admitting it?! Ahh.. Uhm, Just to let you know, I'm one of the cutest girls in this school. You're lucky to be my boyfriend "</p>
<p>It's not like I'm a robot or anything I do have some emotions, I guess, and it's indeed true that someone like me can be counted lucky for having a girlfriend.</p>
<p>Back to the main topic, Kei wanted to tell me that the old Kiyotaka wouldn't threat Nagumo and pick a fight with him like that...</p>
<p>I just learned something new...</p>
<p>Since Kei is my girlfriend I will protect her with everything I got, naturally. But, I wouldn't rush anything. This time I launched an attack based on emotion...</p>
<p>As expected going out with a girl would help me learn a lot... This is fun. This is exactly what I signed for.</p>
<p>" We're eating first I'm kinda hungry "</p>
<p>" Sure "</p>
<p>" How about we ask each others questions till we arrive there "</p>
<p>" Yeah, would you like to begin? "</p>
<p>" Umm The question I always wanted to ask "</p>
<p>" Let's leave that to when we sit down "</p>
<p>I already know what that question is. Don't worry I'm planning to tell you that either way.</p>
<p>" Well, Okay... "</p>
<p>Since I told her I'll answer her later. Kei changed her question</p>
<p>" Then why is someone like you is in Class D. Class D is for lazy and unmatured people or students who have a fucked up past "</p>
<p>" As you can see I'm a lazy student "</p>
<p>" True but the school would've been able to see your potential and probably put you on class B or something "</p>
<p>Well I can't deny that but I'd like to see what Kei thinks</p>
<p>" Then why do you think the school put me in Class D "</p>
<p>" Probably your past I guess "</p>
<p>the analysis that Kei made does sound logical</p>
<p>" I think you killed some people in your past "</p>
<p>" OOOYYY "</p>
<p>" Just kidding but giving the physical strength you have you can beat even adults "</p>
<p>" So do you really think that I'm a serial killer? "</p>
<p>" No I was just kidding but I have a feeling that you have a fucked-up past "</p>
<p>I knew Kei viewed me as a cold and cruel person, but isn't this going a bit too far</p>
<p>" Then I'll tell you that my past has nothing to deal with my assignment to D Class "</p>
<p>" Then I give up tell me already "</p>
<p>Isn't it obvious?</p>
<p>" I rigged the entrance exam "</p>
<p>" Ohhh Now that you're saying it you've always been like that, I totally forgot about that attitude of yours "</p>
<p>We reached the restaurant where we would be having lunch. The conversation was suspended with a natural flow.</p>
<p>As Kei seems to have made a reservation beforehand, she smoothly guides me to our seats. They were towels and splittable chopsticks prepared for two people.</p>
<p>To be continued ...</p>
