Welcome to kei.moe!

I made this site on a whim when I saw a reddit post asking if kei-camp had their own site like hiyorishiina.com, but I only really decided on creating it when I saw kei.moe not taken.

I'll prolly update this site to add fanart, fanfics and Kei's SS. The design will also prolly change as well and I'll prolly open up the source for the site on github eventually when I finialize and clean my shitty code up.
