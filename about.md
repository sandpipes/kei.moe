        <p>Kei best girl.</p>
        <p>I'd like to give a shoutout to <a href="http://hiyorishiina.com">hiyorishiina.com</a> because as you can see, this site was pretty much designed after it.</p>
        <p>This site was made mostly because there wasn't one for Kei (and also because the domain was available).</p><br>
        <p>Join the Classroom of the Elite discord <a href="https://discord.gg/R38FNs6">here</a></p>
        <p>Visit the subreddit as well <a href="https://reddit.com/r/ClassroomOfTheElite">here</a></p><br>
        <p>I am also not a web developer but I tried my best to design a nice looking site and I don't mind getting advice or ideas to add the site!</p>
        <p>I'll prolly open up the source for the site on github eventually when I finalize and clean my shitty code up.</p>
